	<h1>Hampi</h1>
	<p>Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the state of Karnataka, India. It's famous for its ruins, which were once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. The city is surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, temples, and buildings. Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century. It was a fortified city. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest city, after Beijing, and probably India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.</p>
